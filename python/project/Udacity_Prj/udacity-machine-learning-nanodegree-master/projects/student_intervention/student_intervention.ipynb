In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "\n",
    "GENERAL APPLICATIONS\n",
    "* The logistic regression model has been extensively used in numerous disciplines, including Web, medical, social science and educational fields ([Aggarwal, 2015](http://charuaggarwal.net/classbook.pdf); [Peng et al., 2002](http://www-psychology.concordia.ca/fac/kline/734/peng.pdf), [Park, 2013](http://synapse.koreamed.org/Synapse/Data/PDFData/0006JKAN/jkan-43-154.pdf)). In  [Pyke & Sherindan, (1993)](http://journals.sfu.ca/cjhe/index.php/cjhe/article/viewFile/183161/183136), logistic regression was used to predict the retention of 477 master's and 124 doctoral candidates at a large Canadian university.\n",
    "\n",
    "STRENGTHS\n",
    "* Logistc regression models are parsimonious; robust; flexible; easily used; lend itself to a meaningful interpretation; no assumptions are made regarding the distribution of the independent variables ([Pohar et al., 2004](http://www.stat-d.si/mz/mz1.1/pohar.pdf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "WEAKNESSES\n",
    "* To perform well, some assumptions must be considered: cannot predict continuous outcomes; should be fitted correctly, i.e., only the meaningful variables should be included; requires each observation to be independent; the model should have little or no multicollinearity; it requires quite large sample sizes ([Reference](https://www.statisticssolutions.com/assumptions-of-logistic-regression/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "REASONS FOR CHOOSING\n",
    "* The data have a binary outcome variable and more than one categorical and discrate independent (predictor or explanatory) variables ([Peng et al., 2002](http://www-psychology.concordia.ca/fac/kline/734/peng.pdf), [Pohar et al., 2004](http://www.stat-d.si/mz/mz1.1/pohar.pdf)); For binary outcome, logistic regression is one of the most widely used classification methods ([Salazar et al., 2012](https://www.emis.de/journals/RCE/V35/v35n2a03.pdf)).\n",

    "* In [Ghumbre et al. (2011)](http://psrcentre.org/images/extraimages/84.%201211402.pdf), a decision support system based on support vector machine along with a radial basis function network is projected for the diagnosis of heart disease. The diagnosis is carried out utilizing different data samples from India based patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "STRENGTHS\n",
    "* SVM models are based on kernel trick, so they can: use different kernel functions, have good generalization performance even in problems in high dimensions or that are not linearly separable; have a regularisation parameter which reduces overfitting; are defined by a convex optimisation problem, i.e., have absence of local minima ([scikit-learn.org](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html), [stackexchange.com](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/24437/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-svm), [nickgillian.com](http://www.nickgillian.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/GRT/SVM )).\n",
    "\n",
    "WEAKNESSES\n",
    "* However, the models can be quite sensitive to overfitting due the choice of a kernel function and determination of its parameters; have limitation in speed and size: high complexity and memory requirements for quadratic programming in large-scale tasks; optimal design for multiclass SVM classifiers is a further area for research ([stackexchange.com](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/24437/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-svm), [svms.org](http://www.svms.org/disadvantages.html)).\n",

    "\n",
    "STRENGTHS\n",
    "* Decision trees implicitly perform feature selection; require little data preparation (deal with scale, outlier analysis, missing values); nonlinear relationships between parameters do not affect tree performance; easy to interpret and explain ([simafore.com](http://www.simafore.com/blog/bid/62333/4-key-advantages-of-using-decision-trees-for-predictive-analytics)).\n",
    "\n",
    "WEAKNESSES\n",
    "* Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalise the data well (overfitting); can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated; the problem of learning an optimal decision tree is known to be NP-complete under several aspects of optimality.

    "Consider the available studant data set, where we need to predict if a studend will pass or not. Rather than predict the response directly, logistic regression models the probability that a studant belongs to a particular class (yes or not). For this, logistic regression takes features (e.g., age, sex, etc.) about previous students and creates a function (called \"sigmoid\") which assigns a weight for each feature. So when we need to predict a response for a student we summed up the product between the features and its weights and apply this value to the sigmoid function to transform in a probability we can use to understand whether student passed or not."
